A Grafana Loki transport for the nodejs logging library Winston.

## Usage
This Winston transport is used similarly to other Winston transports. Require winston and define a new LokiTransport() inside its options when creating it.

### Options
LokiTransport() takes a Javascript object as an input. These are the options that are available, __required in bold__:

| **Parameter**      | **Description**                                           | **Example**            | **Default**   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------| ------------- |
| __`host`__         | URL for Grafana Loki                                      | http://localhost:3100  | null          |
| `interval`         | The interval at which batched logs are sent in seconds    | 30                     | 5             |
| `json`             | Use JSON instead of Protobuf for transport                | true                   | false         |
| `batching`         | If batching is not used, the logs are sent as they come   | true                   | true          |
| `clearOnError`     | Discard any logs that result in an error during transport | true                   | false         |
| `replaceOnError`   | Replace timestamps and retry on error                     | true                   | false         |
| `replaceTimestamp` | Replace any log timestamps with Date.now()                | true                   | false         |

### Example
```js
const { createLogger, transports } = require("winston");
const LokiTransport = require("winston-loki");
const options = {
  ...,
  transports: [
    new LokiTransport({
      host: "http://localhost:3100"
    })
  ]
  ...
};
const logger = createLogger(options);
```

## Developing
```sh
npm install
npm link
cd ~/your_project
npm link winston-loki
npm install
```
And you should have a working, requirable winston-loki package under your project's node_modules.

Refer to https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/master/docs/api.md for documentation about the available endpoints, data formats etc.

Grafana Loki *doesn't have any official releases or version numbers* as of now, so if the API is changed, it's going to be fun, but it's working as of now.

### Run tests
```sh
npm test
```

Write new ones under `/test`
