# Final verification script for dental hospital module

echo "=== DENTAL HOSPITAL MODULE - FINAL VERIFICATION ==="
echo ""
echo "1. COMPLETED CHANGES:"
echo "   ✅ Fixed _compute_appointment_ids method to properly filter appointments"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced _onchange_patient_id to return dynamic domain"
echo "   ✅ Simplified appointment_id field definition"
echo "   ✅ Updated prescription form view to use onchange domain"
echo "   ✅ Added logging for debugging appointment selection"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced name_get and name_search for appointments"

echo ""
echo "2. TO VERIFY THE FIX:"
echo "   1. Update the module in Odoo:"
echo "      - Go to Apps > Search 'Dental Hospital' > Update"
echo "   2. Create a new prescription:"
echo "      - Go to Dental Clinic > Prescription > Create"
echo "      - Select a patient (John Smith or Jane Doe)"
echo "      - Check that the Appointment field now shows available appointments"
echo "   3. Check the log for debugging info:"
echo "      - Look in Odoo logs for lines starting with 'Prescription'"
echo ""
echo "3. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "   - When you select a patient, the appointment field should update"
echo "   - Appointments should show: APT001, APT002, APT003, APT004"
echo "   - Each appointment should display: Number - Patient (Date) - Doctor [State]"
echo "   - Only non-cancelled appointments from last 30 days should appear"
echo ""
echo "4. IF STILL NOT WORKING:"
echo "   - Check Odoo server logs for any errors"
echo "   - Verify sample data was loaded properly"
echo "   - Restart Odoo server completely"
echo "   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors"
echo ""
echo "5. TROUBLESHOOTING COMMANDS:"
echo "   - Check appointments: SELECT * FROM dental_appointment;"
echo "   - Check patients: SELECT * FROM res_partner WHERE is_patient = true;"
echo "   - Check logs: tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log"
